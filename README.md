# ITProTV karaoke view
A user style for better viewing of episodes on ITProTV along with the rolling transcript. [Published on userstyles.org](https://userstyles.org/styles/137972/itprotv-karaoke-view)

## Description:
Shows episodes on ITProTV with a larger video area, and the rolling transcript just beneath it. Also removes distracting elements while watching.

This is very helpful when you want to watch, read along, plus have a termial or other tool open all at the same time on a single screen.

_This is in BETA, use with caution._

## Details:
This is a simple, hacked together modification of the default CSS of ITProTV's course library watching page. 
It optimizes the viewing experience when reading along the transcript, by moving the transscript very close to the video and removing distracting parts in other areas of the page. The Episode-menu is hidden in a fly-out menu.

Notes: The modification are grouped among visual elements to keep them somewhat easier recognisable and modifiyable.
